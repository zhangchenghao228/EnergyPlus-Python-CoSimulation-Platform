# EnergyPlus-Python-CoSimulation-Platform

An open-source **EnergyPlusâ€“Python co-simulation platform** developed for **multi-zone HVAC control research**.  
This repository provides the **simulation environment, building configurations, and baseline control implementation** used in the related study.

---

## ğŸŒŸ Overview
This platform integrates **EnergyPlus** and **Python** to enable co-simulation for **multi-zone HVAC systems**.  
It allows users to perform customized control and data collection for energy efficiency and thermal comfort evaluation.  

The open-source release includes:
- The complete **co-simulation framework** (EnergyPlusâ€“Python interface)  
- **5-zone** and **28-zone** building models  
- **Two Jinan weather files** for climate-specific testing  
- A **rule-based control (RBC)** implementation as a baseline  

> ğŸ”„ Extended control algorithms (e.g., DRL, MPC) will be gradually released in future updates.
