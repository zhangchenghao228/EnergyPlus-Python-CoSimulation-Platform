# EnergyPlus-Python-CoSimulation-Platform

An open-source **EnergyPlus‚ÄìPython co-simulation platform** developed for **multi-zone HVAC control research**.  
This repository provides the **simulation environment and building configurations** used in the related study, while the **control algorithms** are **not open-sourced at this stage**.

---

## üåü Overview
This platform integrates **EnergyPlus** and **Python** to enable co-simulation for **multi-zone HVAC systems**.  
It allows users to perform customized control and data collection for energy efficiency and thermal comfort evaluation.  

The open-source release includes:
- The complete **co-simulation framework** (EnergyPlus‚ÄìPython interface)  
- **5-zone** and **28-zone** building models  
- **Two Jinan weather files** for climate-specific testing  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The **control algorithms** (e.g., DRL, MPC) used in the original study are **not included** in this repository.
